                <h1 id="client-project">Client Project</h1>
<p>In this unit, our class collaborated with the <a href="http://www.mnhealey.com/MNHEALEY/index.htm">Minnesota Austin Healey Club</a> to provide them with a few pontential website redesigns in the form of a formal report. The report consisted of a project narrative, some sketches and wireframes, descriptions of those materials, and other/general recommendations for the website redesign. For the project, I was assigned to Team Slate, which consisted of myself and three other students from the class. The project consisted of four checkpoints spanning over four weeks:
 1. Needs analysis 
 2. Initial project plan
 3. Progress update
 4. Final report</p>
<h2 id="my-experience-with-the-client-project">My Experience with the Client Project</h2>
<p>The project began with some individual work; we all watched an interview with a member of the club (who also happens to be a professional technical communicator!) and Professor Card. In the interview, they addressed the key issues of the current website and discussed some potential needs for an updated website. By watching the interview, we were all able to obtain a general understanding of what was wrong, what needed to be fixed, and—perhaps most importantly—what <em>could</em> be fixed. Once we completed our individual work, we engaged in the collaborative process of finalizing our team's needs analysis. </p>
<p>Once we completed our needs analysis, we began the redesign process. Our redesign included the website's aesthetics, organization, and the writing (we frequently referenced Janice Redish's book <em>Letting Go of the Words: Writing Web Content that Works</em> for the organization and writing redesign). For the website's organization, we mocked up <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JPuIJ35fOWZZ6Y30ksqlcrkV2igu3ZEI/view?usp=sharing">a few wireframes</a> to provide a basic structure for the website. Once we completed the wireframes, we moved on to more high-fidelity mockups for the website. Here, we were able to incorporate more detailed strucutre, more emphasis on aesthetics, and a polished image of what the final web site resigned could look like (see image below): </p>
<p><img alt="High-fidelity mockup of MN Austin Healey website" src="https://i.gyazo.com/759a8fe6448d2f1fefcd118af23a6c84.png" /></p>
<p>In our final report, we also included a few general recommendations for the writing on the website, and we primarily emphasized hierarchical organization (i.e., put the most important information near the top of each sub-page) and a casual, informal tone. </p>
<p>Overall, I feel incredible fortunate to be a part of Team Slate. All of our team members contributed to the project with their unique skillset (a special shoutout to one team member who brought signficant experience with <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> and was able to design such polished mockups!), and we all got along great. Our meetings were always productive, professional, and respectful; I really cannot say enough positive things about my experience within the group, and I am proud of our final results. </p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-from-the-client-project">Key Takeaways from the Client Project</h2>
<p>Throughout the client project, I learned a lot about collaboration. While we did not get to explore the functionality of Git/Github in this project, I did learn a lot about collaboration within a relatively complex technical communication project. As I mentioned above, all four memebers of our group brought a unique set of skills to the team. Some memembers brought advanced digital literacies with digital design tools, and others brought advanced digital literacies with web authoring tools and web-based rhetoric. Before the client project, I was somewhat insecure about my level of digital literacy: I was not comfortable with digital design tools, and I was just beginning to learn web authoring tools. However, because the strengths of my team memembers made up for my weaknesses, I felt empowered to contribute with the skills I possessed. The key takeaway here, then, is that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and collaborative efforts require professional, respectful, and consistent communication to ensure those strengths and weaknesses are explored in a helpful, productive way. </p>
<p>Through the needs analysis and redesign process, I also learned about a lot about <em>limits</em>. Specifically, I realized that technical communicators must be realistic in their design efforts. In our project, we were limited by time, resources, skillsets—we're only students, after all—and the capabilities/expectations of our clients. Certainly, limits can be frustrating, but they can also create situations where creativity is necessary to get the job done. For my own digital literacy, I quickly realized that I am incredibly limited by factors both within and outside of my own control. By working to push the limits of the factors that I <em>can</em> control (e.g., improving my own digital literacy relative to digital authoring tools and digital design tools), I can contribute to collaborative work in more dynamic ways. Nonetheless, I also need to be aware that I will always experience limits in my work as a technical communicator, and I can use those limits to come up with creative solutions to the problem at hand.  </p>
