                <h1 id="dita">DITA</h1>
<p>From <a href="https://www.xml.com/articles/2017/01/19/what-dita/">XML.org</a>, the Darwin INformation Typing Architecture (DITA) is a standard XML-based architecture. DITA promotes content modularlity and content reuse, and it is frequently used by modern-day technical communicators. To use a little less jargon, DITA fundamentally changes how people create documentation. Rather than write each document individually, DITA promotes writing small sections of documents that can then be reused and/or repurposed across many other documents. Thus, in order to create a larger document, a technical communicator would piece together those sections within a document map. In this section of our course, we were asked to used DITA to create a technical document of our choosing. For my project, I created a set of instructions for making a traditional latte.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience-with-dita">My Experience with DITA</h2>
<p>Much like HTML, CSS, and Git, I immediately felt overwhelmed when I approached DITA. DITA requires a relatively complex syntax, a deep understanding of its purposes and functionality, as well as a relatively deep understanding of a web authoring tool capable of facilitating DITA-based writing. Having learned from our HTML/CSS unit that abstractly approaching these tools does little to help me improve my digital literacy, I immediately downloaded the <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/dita_editor.html">Oxygen XML Editor</a>. Oxygen is a little more complex relative to other XML editors, but it also provides more capabilities and a relatively user-friendly graphical interface. Once I downloaded and installed Oxygen, I began following along a few video guides to learn the basic syntax, functions, and capabilities of DITA. </p>
<p>While these guides were certainly helpful, I nonetheless struggled to fundamentally understand both DITA and Oxygen. In those guides, the instructors emphasized "topic-based authoring", which was an idea I had never heard of prior to my work with DITA. Rather than linearly write an cohesive document, I was supposed to write various "topics" that I would then piece together to create a cohesive document. Not only did it take some time to actually understand <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> that worked, it fundamentally challenged the ways that I thought about writing. I struggled to absorb the philosophy of DITA, but I ultimately persevered (by inputing a whole lot of time...) and learned the fundamentals of the tools. </p>
<p>Once I learned the fundamentals, I began the authoring process for my technical instructions for making a traditional latte. Before I entered into the technical writing and communication program at the University of Minnesota, I was a barista for many years; thus, I thought it would be a fun blend to blend my two professional paths. I wrote a concept topic about the traditional latte, a few task topics for making the traditional latte, as well as a reference topic for the neccessary supplies and equipment. Once I completed the topics, I created a DITA map that structured my instructions in the order that I wanted the audience to read them. If you'd like to see my instructions, feel free to check out <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABd7rb6ngYmonbEIpjhYuHJodhDZ2uVp/view?usp=sharing">a PDF ouput</a> that I generated using Oxygen!</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-from-dita">Key Takeaways from DITA</h2>
<p>I found our sectin on DITA to be the most challenging section of the course. Not only did I have to learn a few new tools, but I also had to <em>relearn</em> how to write. The challenge to relearn how to write revealed a few key weaknesses in my writing. Specifically, I now realize how much I struggle with concision. By writing in topis, I was forced to remove any unneccessary information, as the topics needed to be reusable across many different contexts. I was somewhat shocked at how much <em>more</em> difficult it was to write <em>less</em>. Thus, I greatly appreciated our DITA section for the insights it provided me into myself, especially as an aspiring writer/technical communicator. </p>
<p>Our section on DITA also demonstrated the importance of skills transfer within my digital literacy. By learning the basics of Oxygen, I realized that I am fully capabable of learning most digital tools necessary to be an effective technical communicator. I was able to transfer my learning processes from the earlier sections and learn the basics of a relatively complex digital tool. While I certainly need more work to fully understand these tools, I nonetheless gained confidence in my ability to improve my overall digital literacy. Before this class, I always felt intimidated and overhwelmed by the numerous digital tools within the field of technical communication. However, now that I have this experience, I feel much more comfortable walking into unknown territory. Additionally, because these digital tools are constantly evolving, updating, and changing completely, I believe knowing how to learn is an incredibly valuable long-term skill.</p>
