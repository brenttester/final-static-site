<p>Technical communicators use Git and Github to collaborate on large projects. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a version-control system that tracks any changes made during a collaborative project. <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> utilizes Git and provides collaborators with a platform to host those projects within online repositories. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> allows you to host live web pages directly from Github repositories. If you're looking for an artificat to demonstrate my work with Git, Github, and Github pages... you're looking at it! I used all three tools to publish this digital literacy narrative. </p>
<h2 id="my-experience-with-git-github-and-github-pages">My Experience with Git, Github, and Github Pages</h2>
<p>As I began our unit on Git, I immediately felt intimidated (are you seeing a theme, here?). Git requires significant use of the command line, and I came into the unit with almost zero command line experience. Thankfully, Professor Card provided us with a helpful walkthrough video, and the basic resources made the process a lot easier than I expected. By working with the command line during this unit, I felt much more prepared and comfortable when the command line became essential to making this website. However, to be completely honest, I still do not fully understand the fundamentals of Git. I understand its basic purpose, but I do not really understand what is happening when I enter certain commands into the command line. I primarily attribute this to my over-reliance on Github, which provided me with a graphic interface for creating a repository. In the future, I need to re-visit Git to fully understand its purpose and full functions. </p>
<p>In this unit, I used Git, Github, and Github Pages to host a live version of <a href="https://brenttester.github.io/tester-demo/">my first static site</a>. As I mentioned above, I over-relied on Github throughout this unit, as it provides a graphical user interface. While I did not understand the fundamentals of Git (i.e., I had a hard time fully utilizing the command line with Git), I did begin to understand the <em>potential</em> for collaboration using these tools. I managed to host a repository, make a clone of the repository, make a few local changes, and push those changes back into the hosted version. Addiitionally, using Github, I could see the specific changes I made, as well as when I made those changes to the intial version. In the future, I'd like to use Git and Github in a collaborative setting, as we only engaged with the tools at an individual level. </p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-from-git-github-and-github-pages">Key Takeaways from Git, Github, and Github Pages</h2>
<p>The most important takeaway from our Git, Github, and Github Pages unit was how important version control is within a collaborative seeting, especially within larger technical communication projects. During my time in the technical writing and communication program, I have only engaged in collaborative projects within the Google Suite (e.g., Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Drive, etc.). While those tools are great for simple projects, I cannot fathom effectively collaborating on projects that involve many more people, teams, and/or departments, especially when timelines are not as aligned as they are within the college setting. Git and Github seem like incredibly important and effective tools for larger-scale collaboration, and I hope to learn more about those processes in the near future. </p>
<p>As for Github Pages, I learned about a great web page hosting service, and it was awesome to see my first static site live on the internet. By working with Git, Github, and Github Pages, I feel much more confident creating a web project, hosting the web project, and sharing it with future collaborators. </p>
