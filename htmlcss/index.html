                <h1 id="html-and-css">HTML and CSS</h1>
<p>Technical communicators often use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in combination with one another to build web pages from the ground up. In WRIT 4662W, we began the course by learning the basics of HTML and CSS to build a basic static site. If you'd like to see my first project in the course, <a href="https://brenttester.github.io/tester-demo/">feel free to check it out!</a></p>
<h2 id="my-experience-with-htmlcss">My Experience with HTML/CSS</h2>
<p>Before taking WRIT 4662W, I had almost zero experience with web design/web-based writing. In previous courses, I "designed" a few basic web pages using content management systems (CMS), with Google Sites being the CMS I most frequently used. During the first week of this course, we were asked to create our initial digital literacy narratives. I created my <a href="https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/brenttesterdigitalliteracy">initial digital literacy narrative</a> using Google Sites, and I immediately remembered how restrictive, uncreative, but nonetheless straightforward the tool was.</p>
<p>In the new few weeks of the course, we began to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, and I immediately noticed how much more dynamic, creative, but nonetheless complicated these tools could be. Initially, I was completely overwhelmed; I had never learned a coding language before, and I was incredibly intimidated to start from scratch, so to speak. I read a few guides and watched a few informative videos, but I still did not know know exactly how these tools worked, nor did I really understand how they worked in combination with one another. </p>
<p>After being frustrated for some time, I decided to experiment with some basic code that Professor Card provided the class. Rather than try to learn HTML/CSS in the abstract, I used Professor Card's code to experiement with the inputs and values. By manipulating his code is various ways, I quickly learned what each "tag" did for the overall structure and/or aesthetic of the web page. After a few hours of experimenting and absorbing some more basic information, I felt confident enough to build the basic structure of my own static site. </p>
<p>This method of trial and error proved to be the most effective way to learn. For HTML, I would add a line of code to my index, refresh my local web page, and see how the page was different from the previous version. For CSS, I would add a line of code, manipulate the values a few times, and see how those changes affected the various versions. Additionally, I quickly learned that <em>time</em> is perhaps the most important part of learning HTML/CSS. I spent many hours tinkering with my code, and that process was much more valuable than reading abstract ideas about the tools, although that information was certainly important. </p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-from-htmlcss">Key Takeaways from HTML/CSS</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, the notion of trial and error was perhaps the most important realization I made during our HTML/CSS unit. Coming from a writing background, trial and error is more-or-less comparable to the drafting process; however, I experienced far more errors in the web design process than I ever had in the traditional writing process. What I took away from HTML/CSS, then, was that making errors is an essential part of the process, and my frustration only showed that I was invested in actually improving my digital literacy by learning the fundamentals of HTML/CSS. Additionally, because I needed to make these errors to better understand these tools, I also needed to set aside adequate <em>time</em> to engage in that trial and error process. </p>
<p>By working with HTML/CSS (as well as reading <a href="http://www.xchanges.org/rhetorical-web-design-thinking-critically?page=1">a great article by Jason Tham</a>), I also realized the <em>potential</em> for rhetorical flexibility with HTML/CSS. That is, I realized that the "from the ground up" approach to web design affords technical communicators much more flexibility in approaching various rhetorical situations. While I certainly am limited by my relativley basic level of understanding, I nonetheless understand how valuable these digital tools are within the larger project of creating more effective communication materials. </p>
