                <h1 id="markdown">Markdown</h1>
<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language, and it is the language that I used to write this website! Much like my work with Git, Github, and Github Pages, if you're looking for an artificant to demonstrate my work with Markdown... you're still looking at it! Markdown's syntax is super simple, but it nonetheless provides enough capabilities to make some pretty cool documentation. Using Markdown, I wrote a summary of a <a href="https://lavacon.org/2020/">Lavacon 2020</a> presentation titled "UX and Hip Hop: A Love Story" by Mike Walkusky. In this section of the course, we also discussed and experimented with some static site generators such as <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. You can checkout <a href="https://danieljcard1.github.io/lavadocs/">a collection of our Lavacon summaries</a> that we wrote using Markdown, which Professor Card created using MkDocs. For this project, I used MkDocs to generate my static site. </p>
<h2 id="my-experience-with-markdown-and-static-site-generators">My Experience with Markdown and Static Site Generators</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Markdown is relatively simple. I began by learning the basic syntax, which only took a couple of hours total. I appreciated the readability, familiarity, and intuitiveness of the language. Nonetheless, there were a few features that took some time to learn, such as embdedding links and images within the text. To show the basic structure and syntax of markdown, here's a screenshot of a page of code from this website: </p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Markdown structure and syntax" src="https://i.gyazo.com/8891eb5dbe7d37a16aadb22f44f1c6f4.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the inputs are relatively straightforward, but there are still some features that take some time to learn. I appreciated the Lavacon 2020 assignment in combination with our Markdown unit, too. I learned a lot about content management strategy, and it was fascinating to hear industry professionals talk about the future of technical writing and communication at such a high level. Overall, I found this to be the most straightforward, efficient, and intuitive tool that we covered in the course. </p>
<p>As for the static site generator... I was forced to revist the command line. As I previously mentioned, I used MkDocs to create this website. MkDocs requires some work with the command line, and I followed Professor Card's lead to learn the basics of working with the tool. This time around, I felt much more comfortable operating the command line; here's a screenshot of me generating a local version of this website for testing purposes: </p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of command line using MkDocs" src="https://i.gyazo.com/609bbbb6f85cd0a23957e0761cf86299.png" /></p>
<p>While I still have much to learn about the command line, I'm glad that I revisted the tool and became more familiar with it. </p>
<h2 id="takeaways-from-markdown-and-static-site-generators">Takeaways from Markdown and Static Site Generators</h2>
<p>Our unit on Markdown and Static Site Generators showed me that not <em>everything</em> within technical communication needs to be complicated! Markdown is relatively simple, but that does not mean it is not effective. For certain rhetorical situations, more complex, dynamic tools (e.g., HTML and CSS) are certainly necessary. However, in other rhetorical situations, simple tools like Markdown are incredible effective. If I need to quickly make web documentation that is straight to the point, Markdown is a great option. </p>
<p>Similarly, static site generators make the web publishing process much simpler. By automatically translating Markdown files, static site generators offer an incredibly efficient way to make important web pages. Certainly, it is important to understand <em>both</em> the automatic and the manual processes for web authoring and publishing, and I felt like our section on Markdown and Static Site Generators was a great way of combining those two processes. </p>
